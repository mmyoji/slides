## My Dev Env

* Xubuntu 17.10
* xfce4-terminal (default terminal)
* tmux+neovim(dein)

---

## Xubuntu

* [ysksn](https://github.com/ysksn) told me
* Almost Ubuntu, but lighter
* Actually I wanna install/use [BunsenLabs Linux](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) ...
    * ぱそこんむずかしい。。。
* Easy to use for Linux Desktop beginners

---

## xfce4-terminal

* I don't have strong preferences with terminal
* **Font** is really important to motivate myself
    * [random-font](https://gist.github.com/mmyoji/0bd00f9a9e99fc6ce10c9b3640bb7fbe)
* Window's transparency is enabled for 写経

first of all,

**I DON'T WANT TO START A WAR**

---

## My Editor History

* 2013~ SublimeText2
* 2014~ Emacs
* 2016~ Vim
* 2017~ NeoVim

---

## My Thoughts to Editor

* Don't want to launch an app to use editor
* Emacs had made me most productive
* Changed to Vim to criticize itself

---

## Why NeoVim

* Much faster than Vim
* 厨二病

---

Do not upgrade x.10 Ubuntu!

cannot use `stable` ppa...

`unstable` neovim's sometimes broken.

---

## Plugin manager

[dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

* Maintained by Shougo-san
* Manage plugins in `*.toml`
* I separated config files from normal vim
  * Vim: `$HOME/.vimrc`
  * NeoVim: `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim`
